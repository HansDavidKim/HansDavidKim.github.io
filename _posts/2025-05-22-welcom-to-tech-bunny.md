This is Tech blog of Hans, who is majoring in `Economics` and `Computer Science & Engineering` at `Sogang University`, Seoul, South Korea.

My most interest is a `Generative AI`techniques like `Stable Diffusion`, and `Reinforcement Learning`with Transformer-based architectures.

I address not only Deep Learning techniques, but also overall architectures, mechanisms, and algorithms of Computer Science.

I am currently working on studying `Python-based Web frameworks`like `Django`and `FastAPI` to implement `Librarian System` for `SGCC` and `Release`; both are developer community of `Sogang University`.
