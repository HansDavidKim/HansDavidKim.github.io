#### Floating-Point Addition

I talked about how floating point addition works in terms of algorithms.
This time, however, we will talk about the very same topic in perspective of computer architecture (or organization).

We first calculate difference between exponent and adjust small exponent to bigger one (with shifting fraction right).
Then we add fractions with Big ALU; hidden bits are augmented before they go through.

```markdown
4-bit fraction (for example)
0010 -> (1)0010
```

After the operation, floating point adder tries to normalize by making hidden bit MSB
(which implies that hardware can detect overflow).

After that, the result of normalization go through rounding hardware at last.

Below is illustration of how floating point adder architecture consists of.

#### Floating-Point Multiplication
Subtraction implementation is not hard as it uses signed magnitude approach.

The second most frequently used Floating point arithmetic is multiplication.
We can summarize procedures like below.

1. Add exponents
2. Multiply significands
3. Normalize result & check for over/underflow
4. Round and renormalize if necessary
5. Determine sign of result from signs of operands

Let's see an example in decimal below.

example >

##### 1. Add exponentns
$1.110 \times 10^{10} \times 9.200 \times 10^{-5}$
$New\,exponent=10+(-5)=-5$

##### 2. Multiply significands
$1.110 \times 9.200 = 10.212 \times 10^5$

##### 3. Normalize result & check for over/underflow
$1.0212 \times 10^6$

##### 4. Round and renormalize if necessary
$1.021 \times 10^6$

##### 5. Determine sign of results from signs of operands
$+1.021 \times 10^6$

Like you might assume, the complexity of multiplication is similar to addition.
Only distinct difference is that they multiply significands other than addition.

These floating point operations usually take several cycles (can be pipelined indeed).

#### FP instructions in MIPS
Floating point hardware is co-processor 1
(co-processor is additional processor that aids CPU).

There are registers only for floating point numbers unlike general registers we addressed before.
There exists 32 32-bits floating point registers for single precision and we couple them like f0/f1 for double precision.

One distinct feature is that, there is no such operations between floating point register and integer register.
Only the floating point registers are used for those operations.

```markdown
lwc1 : Load word e.g) lwc1 $f1, 32($sp)
ldc1 : Load double-word e.g) ldc1 $f0, 32($sp)
swc1 : Store word e.g) swc1 $f1, 32($sp)
sdc1 : Store double-word e.g) sdc1 $f1, 32($sp)
```

I will handle more instructions of floating operations at next post.
Thank you for reading my post, and have a nice day.
