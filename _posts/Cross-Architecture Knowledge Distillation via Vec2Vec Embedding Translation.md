**Problem Statement & Motivation**

Traditional knowledge distillation methods fail when teacher and student models have different architectures, tokenizers, or embedding dimensions. Vec2Vec demonstrates that neural networks trained with similar objectives converge to a universal latent representation that can be learned and harnessed for translation between embedding spaces[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2). This breakthrough enables knowledge transfer without paired data or access to the original encoders.

## **Refined Objectives**

**Primary Goal:** Develop an enhanced Vec2Vec-based framework that enables effective knowledge distillation between heterogeneous LLMs by learning universal embedding translations.

**Specific Aims:**

- Implement and extend Vec2Vec's adversarial training with cycle consistency for LLM embedding translation
    
- Integrate geometric alignment losses (reconstruction, cycle-consistency, vector space preservation) to maintain semantic relationships[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    
- Evaluate cross-tokenizer knowledge transfer capabilities on standard benchmarks
    
- Compare against both naive baselines and optimal assignment methods
    

## **Enhanced Methodology**

**Architecture Design:**  
Following Vec2Vec's modular approach, implement space-specific adapters (A₁, A₂) that transform embeddings into a universal latent space via a shared backbone network T[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2). The translation functions become:

- F₁ = B₂ ∘ T ∘ A₁ (teacher → student translation)
    
- F₂ = B₁ ∘ T ∘ A₂ (student → teacher translation)
    

**Multi-Objective Loss Function:**  
Implement Vec2Vec's comprehensive loss combining:

- **Adversarial Loss:** Ensures translated embeddings match target distributions at both embedding and latent levels[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    
- **Reconstruction Loss:** Enforces that embeddings mapped to latent space and back preserve original representations
    
- **Cycle-Consistency Loss:** Acts as unsupervised proxy for pair alignment, ensuring F₂(F₁(x)) ≈ x[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    
- **Vector Space Preservation:** Maintains pairwise relationships between embeddings under translation[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    

**Evaluation Framework:**

- **Translation Quality:** Mean cosine similarity, Top-1 accuracy, and mean rank metrics as established in Vec2Vec[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    
- **Semantic Preservation:** Zero-shot attribute inference and embedding inversion to verify that translations retain semantic information[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    
- **Task Performance:** GLUE, SQuAD, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks for downstream validation
    

## **Expected Contributions & Impact**

**Theoretical Contributions:**

- Empirical validation of the Strong Platonic Representation Hypothesis for text models in knowledge distillation contexts[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2)
    
- Demonstration that universal geometric relationships can enable cross-architecture knowledge transfer
    

**Practical Applications:**

- Enable knowledge distillation between models with incompatible tokenizers (e.g., LLaMA3 → Qwen/GPT-2)
    
- Provide lightweight alternative to retraining when adapting knowledge across model families
    
- Support deployment in resource-constrained environments through efficient embedding translation
    

**Security Implications:**  
Following Vec2Vec's findings, demonstrate that translated embeddings can reveal sensitive information about original documents, highlighting privacy considerations in embedding-based systems[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2).

## **Key Enhancements from Vec2Vec Integration**

**Methodological Rigor:** Adopting Vec2Vec's proven architecture with adapters and shared backbone ensures robust embedding translation[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2).

**Comprehensive Evaluation:** Using Vec2Vec's established metrics (cosine similarity up to 0.92, perfect matching on 8000+ embeddings) provides clear performance benchmarks[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2).

**Semantic Validation:** Incorporating attribute inference and inversion techniques demonstrates that translations preserve meaningful semantic information beyond geometric structure[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2).

**Broader Applicability:** Vec2Vec's success with multimodal models (CLIP) suggests potential for extending knowledge distillation across modalities[](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12540v2).

This enhanced proposal leverages Vec2Vec's breakthrough in unsupervised embedding translation to address the fundamental challenge of cross-architecture knowledge distillation, providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions for modern LLM deployment scenarios.
